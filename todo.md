Documentaion Page coding challange

Problem definition
The second feature in the sprint is to create the top part of the new documentation home page. Unlike the React app above, the documentation is a publicly available source of information and must be highly accessible. Using the supplied design, create the HTML for the design. No CSS, No JS, no frameworks - just plain old semantic HTML (POSH).
